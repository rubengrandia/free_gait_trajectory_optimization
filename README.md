# free_gait_trajectory_optimization

Summary
This repo containts the prototype for connecting free gait with trajectory optimization.

Trajectory optimization
The implemented trajectory optimization is described in:
Pardo, Diego, et al. "Hybrid direct collocation and control in the constraint-consistent subspace for dynamic legged robot locomotion." Robotics Science and Systems. 2017.
